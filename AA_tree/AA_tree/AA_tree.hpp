 AA tree is named after its invertor Arne Andersson, please refer to his paper for more detail.
 For your convenience, the paper is included in the directory.
 
 AA tree is a viriation of red black tree.
 We adopt a few rules:
 1.Only right children can be red.
 2.We code our procedures recursively.
 3.Instead of storing a color bit with each node, we store information in a short integer.This information is the level of a node.The level of a node is :
 *One if the node is a leaf.
 *The level of its parent, if the node is red.
 *One less then the level of its parent,if the node is black.
