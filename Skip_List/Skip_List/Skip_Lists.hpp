 Skip lists are a data structure that can be used in place of balanced trees. Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strictly enforced balancing and as a result the algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are much simpler and significantly faster than equivalent algorithms for balanced trees.
 The following code was formed from the paper that issued by William Pugh in 1990. For convenience, that paper is included in this directory, please refer to "pugh-skiplists-cacm1990.pdf" for more detail.
