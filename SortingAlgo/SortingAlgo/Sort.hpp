 Shellsort,named after its inventor Donald shell
 Shellsort uses a sequence,h_1,h_2,...h_t,called the increment sequence where h_1=1
 After a phase,using some increment h_k,for every i, we have A[i]<=A[i+h_k].
 All elements spaced h_k apart are sorted.The array is then said to be h_k-sorted.
 An important property of Shellsort is that an h_k-sorted array is then h_(k-1) sorted
 remains h_k-sorted.
 Hibbard suggested a increment sequence of the form:1,3,7,..2^k-1
 Worst-case of Shellsort using Hibbard's increments is \theta(N^(3/2))

 Priority queues can be used to sort in O(NlogN) time.
 The basic strategy is:
 1.Build a binary heap of N elements which takes O(N) time
 2.Perform N DeleteMin operations.The elements leave the heap smallest first, in sorted order.
which takes O(NlogN) time.

 Mergesort runs in O(NlogN) worst-case running time, and the number of comparison
 used is nearly optimal.
 The fundamental operation in this algorithm is merging two sorted lists.
 This algorithm is a classic divide-and-conquer strategy.

/*
 As its name implies, quicksort is the fastest known sorting algorithm in practice.
 Average-case:O(NlogN), It is very fast, mainly due to a very tight
 and highly optimized inner loop
 Worst-case:O(N^2), It can be made exponentially unlikely with a little effort.
 \Omega(NlogN), Every algorithm that uses only comparison has this lower bound in worst-case.

 Quicksort can be modified to solve the selection problem.
 The steps of quickselect are:
 1.if |S|<=Cutoff, then sort S and return the kth smallest element.
 2.pick a pivot element, v \in S.
 3.partition S-{v} into S_1 and S_2, as was done with quicksort
 4.if k<=|S_1|, then the kth smallest element must be in S_1. In this case, return
 quickselect(S_1,k). if k==1+|S_1| ,then the pivot is the kth smallest element, just return it.
 Otherwise, the kth smallest element lies in S_2, and it is the (k-|S_1|-1)st smallest element
 in S_2. In this case, return quickselect(S_2,k-|S_1|-1).
