 A red-black tree is a binary tree that satisfy the following red-black properties:
 1.Every node is either red or black
 2.The root is black
 3.Every leaf(nil) is black
 4.If a node is red, then both its children are black.(Node that two red nodes can not be adjacent,but black nodes can adjacent to red node or black node.)
 5.For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendent leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
 Hence, we can define black-height of a node to be this number.
 
 For 3 insertion cases , please refer to insertion_case.jpg
 For 4 deletion cases , please refer to deletion_case.jpg
 Lemma:A red-black tree with n internal nodes has height at most 2log(n+1)
