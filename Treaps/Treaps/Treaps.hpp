 Treap is so simple, and the time for a single operation is much higher compared with previous balanced trees.
 But it still have O(logN) expected time for each operation !
 We decide to implement the Treap non-recursively for better performance and understanding .
 For more detail, please refer to the paper "Treap.pdf".
