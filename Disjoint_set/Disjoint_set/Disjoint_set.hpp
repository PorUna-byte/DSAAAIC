 Find the set which contains element X while using path compression strategy.
 The effect of path compression is that every node on the path from X to the root has its parent changed to the root.
 Path compression is perfectly compatible with union-by-size(which we use above)
 Theorem:Any sequence of M=\Omega(N) (M is the number of union operations, N is the number of Find operations)
 take a total of O(Mlog*N) running time (log*N is the number of times the logarithm of N needs to be applied until result <=1, eg log*65536=4 since loglogloglog65536=1)
