 Perform the single source shortest path algorithm.

 O(|V|^2+|E|)=O(|V|^2)     if not use a priority queue, suits dense graph(|E|=\theta(|V|^2)).
 Note that Dijkstra works iff all edges are non-negative(>=0) .
 Why Dijkstra's can not handle the negative edge?
 Dijkstra's is an instance of greedy-algorithm.
 when we choose the current unknown vertex with minimum distance from source at each iteration,
  we mark it known and we assume it's distance would not change any more. So, we process one vertex per iteration and would not modify its distance later if it has been marked known.
 But, if the existence of negative edges are allowed, things are different.
 We CAN NOT guarantee that the known vertex's distance would not be modified later by other vertices if negative edges are allowed !

/*
 This Algorithm still works when negative cost edges exist,but the efficiency is frustrating.
 Note that negative cost edges are allowed, but negative cycle are not allowed,Since the existence of negative
 cycle will lead to undefined -oo .
 Time complexity:O(|E||V|)
 Why WeightedNegative can handle the negative edges?
 Note that the reason that the Dijkstra's can not work with negative edges lies in the known vertices' distance may
 be modified later.(even if they are marked known before.)
 So, one of the simple and brutal method to solve this problem is ignore the known information, that is we don't maintian known information any more.Every time we have an opportunity to slack a vertex, just slack it !
 You need convince yourself that this algorithm actually converges/terminates given enough time.

 This algorithm aims to find a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph.
 A minimum spanning tree of an undirected graph G is a tree formed from graph edges that connects all the vertices
 of G at lowest total cost.
 We can see that Prim's is essentially identical to Dijkstra's.But, there is slight difference in the meaning(hence the update)of distance. Here, distance is the weight of the shortest arc from a known vertex to this vertex.(In dijkstra's distance is the total cost of shortest path from source to this vertex)
 Complexity is the same as dijkstra's:
 O(|E|log|V|+|V|log|V|)=O(|E|log|V|) if use a priority queue, suits sparse graph(|E|=\theta(|V|)).
 O(|V|^2+|E|)=O(|V|^2)     if not use a priority queue, suits dense graph(|E|=\theta(|V|^2)).

  This algorithm aims to find a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph.
  Kruskal's is another example of greedy algorithm which continually to select the edges in order of smallest weight
 and accept an edge if it does not cause a cycle.
 Formally, Kruskal's maintains a forest.Initially, there are |V| single-node trees.Adding an edge merges two trees into one. When the algorithm terminates, there is only one tree, and this is the minimum spanning tree.
 So, the appropriate data structure is Disjoint set.
 Time complexity for Kruskal's is:O(ElogE)
