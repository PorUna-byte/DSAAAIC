//  Segment_tree
/*Let us consider the following problem to understand Segment Trees.
We have an array arr[0 . . . n-1]. We should be able to
1 Find the sum of elements from index l to r where 0 <= l <= r <= n-1
2 Change value of a specified element of the array to a new value x. We need to do arr[i] = x where 0 <= i <= n-1.
 
 A solution is to create another array and store sum from start to i at the ith index in this array. The sum of a given range can now be calculated in O(1) time, but update operation takes O(n) time now. This works well if the number of query operations is large and very few updates.
 What if the number of query and updates are equal? Can we perform both the operations in O(log n) time once given the array? We can use a Segment Tree to do both operations in O(Logn) time.
