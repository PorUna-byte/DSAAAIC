 Theorem:A leftist tree with r nodes on the right path must have at least 2^r-1 nodes.
 The proof is by induction.
 The time to perform merge is proportional to the sum of the length of the right paths.
 Since constant work is performed at each root node visited during the recursive calls.
 Thus we obtain an O(logN) time bound to merge two leftist heaps.
 N is the sum of nodes in both leftist heaps.

 Note that the recursive fashion of Merge is easy to implement,
 but it is hard to know how the merging work is actually done(because the os&compiler has done much
 work in recursive fuction and provide an abstract view for programers)
 What's more,recursive function adds some overhead.
 So,here I decide to implement a non-recursive fashion of Merge.(both for efficiency and clarity)
 
 Here is a brief description for how the routine work:
 In the first pass ,we create a new tree by merging the right paths of both heaps.
 To do this, we arrange the nodes on the right paths of H1 and H2 in sorted order,keeping their respective
 left children.
 In the second pass,we traverse bottom-up the heap,and childs swaps are performed at nodes that violates
 the leftist heap property(the left subtree has a higher or equal npl than the right subtree.)
